This Dapp is a complete EVM signature toolbox to sign and verify signatures, supporting signature and validation of regular messages, typed data messages (EIP-712) and smart contract signatures (EIP-1271)

It uses the library @ambire/signature-validator, which makes the signatures verifications in your dapp as easy as possible.
